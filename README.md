# YOLOv7-to-be-used-on-Grad-CAM
This repos provides modifications on YOLOv7 model and add classes to make it useable with pytorch Grad-CAM


This repository extends the [YOLOv7 model](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7), originally created by WongKinYiu and contributors, by integrating Grad-CAM for enhanced explainability of object detection results. YOLOv7 is known for its high performance in real-time object detection tasks and is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

## Acknowledgments
- Thanks to the creators of the original [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) for providing a robust base model that this project builds upon.
- And thanks to the creators of Grad-CAM code [pytorch-grad-cam](https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam).
